    "        * <ins>Discrete Data</ins>: Integer based; Often counts of some event.\n",
    "            * *Ex.* How many purchases did a customer make in a year?\n",
    "            * *Ex.* How many times did I flip \"heads\"?\n",
    "        * <ins>Continuous Data</ins>: Decimal based; Has an infinite number of possible values.\n",
    "            * *Ex.* How much time did it take for a user to check out?\n",
    "            * *Ex.* How much rain fell on a given day?\n",
    "* **Categorical**: Qualitative data that has no inherent mathematical meaning.\n",
    "    * *Exs.* Gender, yes/no (binary data), race, state of residence, product category, political party, *etc.*\n",
    "    * You can assign numbers to categories in order to represent them more compactly, but the numbers don't have mathematical meaning.\n",
    "* **Ordinal**: A mix of numerical and categorical; Categorical data that has mathematical meaning.\n",
    "    * *Ex.* Movie ratings on a 1 - 5 scale (1 being the worst, 5 being the best)"
