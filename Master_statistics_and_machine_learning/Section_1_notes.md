## Section 1: What are (is?) data?
### Is "data" singular or plural?!?!!?!
Both [Thesaurus.com](https://www.thesaurus.com/e/grammar/data-is-or-data-are/) and [The BMJ](https://www.bmj.com/content/380/bmj.p529) ([full article here](https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/380/bmj.p529.full.pdf)) offer great explanations as to how 'data' can be used in a singular or plural manner.

Quick summary from [Thesaurus.com](https://www.thesaurus.com/e/grammar/data-is-or-data-are/):
> The word data can be either singular or plural depending on meaning and context. In general usage, data is treated as singular when used as a mass noun to mean “information” and as plural when used to mean “individual facts.” In scientific and academic writing, data is almost always used as a plural noun. In digital technology, data is usually treated as a singular mass noun to mean “digitally stored information.” 

### Where does data come from and what do they mean?
Potentially anywhere and everywhere - so long as it's recorded (spreadsheets, databases, *etc.*).

### Types of data: categorical, numerical, etc.
