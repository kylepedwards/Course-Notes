# 1. Data and Statistics Foundation

## What is Data and Information?
(From [Statistics for AI Data Science and Business Analysis - 2024](https://www.udemy.com/course/statistics-probability-for-data-science).)

**"Data"** and **"information"** are often used interchangeably, but they aren't the same.

* **Data**: 
    * A collection of individual facts or statistics; Raw form of knowledge.
    * <ins>Comes in various forms</ins>: Text, observations, figures, numbers, graphs, *etc.*
        * <ins>Examples</ins>: Individual prices, weights, addresses, ages, names, temperatures, dates, distances, *etc.*
    * <ins>Types of Data</ins>:
        * **Quantitative Data**: Deals with numerical data (eg. salary, weight, *etc.*).
        * **Qualitative Data**: Deals with non-numerical data (eg. name, gender, *etc.*).

* **Information**: 
    * Knowledge gained through study, communication, research, or instruction; Result of analyzing and interpreting pieces of data.
    * <ins>Example</ins>:
        * **Data**: Temperature readings in a location.
        * **Information**: Determine seasonal temperature patterns.

## Differences between Data and Information
(From [Statistics for AI Data Science and Business Analysis - 2024](https://www.udemy.com/course/statistics-probability-for-data-science).)

Both are critical elements in business decision-making.

| **Data** | **Information** |
| :-----: | :-----: |
| A collection of facts. | Puts facts into context. |
| Raw and unorganized. | Organized. |
| Individual and sometimes unrelated. | Maps out data to provide a big-picture view of how it all fits together. |
| Meaningless on its own. | Data becomes meaningful after analysis and interpretation. |
| Doesn't depend on information. | Depends on data. |
| Typically comes in the form of graphs, numbers, figures, or statistics. | Typically presented through words, language, thoughts, and ideas. |
| Insufficient for decision-making. | Sufficient for decision-making. |

## Is data singular or plural?!?!!?!
(From [Master statistics & machine learning](https://www.udemy.com/course/statsml_x), but I didn't like the instructor's answer (and complaining) - so here's some [copypasta](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/copypasta).)

* <ins>From [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/eb/qa/Is-Data-Singular-or-Plural-)</ins>: "Technically, "data" is a plural noun—it is the plural form of the noun "datum." However, it is used with both singular and plural verbs."
* <ins>From [Thesaurus](https://www.thesaurus.com/e/grammar/data-is-or-data-are/)</ins>: "In general usage, data is treated as both a singular and a plural word. When data is used as a mass noun (a noun that can't be counted, like sand) to mean “information,” it typically uses a singular verb."
* <ins>From [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/collective-nouns/)</ins>: "Collective nouns are singular in form but plural in meaning. In American English, they are usually treated as singular and followed by a singular verb. However, many of them can be treated as plural in contexts where the emphasis is on the individual members or components of a group rather than on the group as a whole."

## Where does data come from and what do they mean?
(From [Master statistics & machine learning](https://www.udemy.com/course/statsml_x).)

Everywhere/many sources.

## Types of data: categorical, numerical, etc.
(From [Master statistics & machine learning](https://www.udemy.com/course/statsml_x).)

A disambiguation from the instructor:
| **"Data type" in computer science** | **"Data type" in statistics** |
| :-----: | :-----: |
| Format of data storage. | Category of data. |
| <ins>Implications</ins>: operations, storage space | <ins>Implications</ins>: Appropriate statistical procedures |
| <ins>Examples</ins>: floating-point, boolean, string | <ins>Examples</ins>: look at the table beneath this one |

Data types distinguished/used in this course ([Master statistics & machine learning](https://www.udemy.com/course/statsml_x)).
* <ins>**Category**</ins>:
    * **Numerical (numbers)**:
        * <ins>Numerical Types</ins>:
            * **Interval**: Numeric scale with meaningful intervals (ex. Temp. in C).
            * **Ratio**: Interval, but also with meaningful zero (ex. Height in cm).
            * **Discrete**: No arbitrary precision (integers) (ex. Population).
    * **Categorical (labels)**:
        * <ins>Categorical Types</ins>:
            * **Ordinal**: Sortable, discrete (ex. education (high school, university, *etc.*)).
            * **Nominal**: Non-sortable discrete (ex. movie genre (sci-fi, romcom, *etc.*)).

## Sample vs. population data
(From [Master statistics & machine learning](https://www.udemy.com/course/statsml_x).)

* **Population**: Data from ALL members of a group.
    * <ins>Example</ins>: Salaries in a department; Number of lions in a zoo; Facebook group members.
    * <ins>Notation for Population ***parameters***</ins>: $\mu$ (mu), $\beta$ (beta), $\sigma^2$ (sigma squared)

* **Sample**: Data from SOME members of a group (hopefully randomly selected).
    * <ins>Example</ins>: Average height of Italians; Salaries of teachers; Brightness of stars in the Milky Way galaxy.
    * <ins>Notation for Sample ***estimates***</ins>: $\hat{\mu}$ (or $\bar{x}$), $\hat{\beta}$ (or $\beta$), $\hat{\sigma}^2$ (or $s^2$)

## Statistics
(From [Statistics for AI Data Science and Business Analysis - 2024](https://www.udemy.com/course/statistics-probability-for-data-science).)

**Statistics**: The practice or science of collecting and analyzing numerical data in large quantities, especially for the purpose of inferring proportions in a whole from those in a representative sample.

**Statistical Analysis**: The science of collecting, exploring, and presenting large amounts of data to discover underlying patterns and trends.
