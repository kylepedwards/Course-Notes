# 2. Types of Statistical Analysis

## Statistical Analysis Types
* **Statistics Analysis Types**:
    * **Descriptive Statistics**: Helps us summarize the data.
        * <ins>Types of Descriptive Statistics</ins>: 
        * <ins>**Measures of Central Tendency**</ins>: Focuses on the average or middle values of data sets.
            * **Measures of Central Tendency** describes the center position of a distribution for a data set.
            * A person analyzes the frequency of each data point in the distribution and describes it by using the **mean**, **median**, or **mode**, which measures the most common patterns of the analyzed data set.
            * <ins>Example</ins>: The sum of the following data set - **(2, 3, 4, 5, 6)** - is: 20
                * **Mean**: 4 (20/5)
                * **Median**: 4
                * **Mode**: Null
        * <ins>**Measures of Variability**</ins>: Focuses on the dispersion of data.
            * **Measures of Variability** (or **Measures of Spread**) aid in analyzing how dispersed the distribution is for a set of data.
            * Includes **standard deviation**, **variance**, **minimum** and **maximum variables**, **kurtosis**, and **skewness**.
            * **Measures of Central Tendency** may give a person the average of a data set, it doesn't describe how the data is distributed within the set. **Measures of Variability** helps describe the shape and spread of the data set.
        * Can we use **Descriptive Statistics** to make an inference or prediction? No, that job belongs to **Inferential Statistics**.

    * **Inferential Statistics**: Helps us make inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample.
