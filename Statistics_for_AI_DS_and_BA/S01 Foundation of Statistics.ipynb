    ">\"Statistics\" and \"statistical\" are related terms but have different meanings:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">    1. **Statistics**: Statistics is a field of study that involves collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. It deals with the methods for collecting, summarizing, and interpreting data to make decisions and draw conclusions. Statistics involves techniques such as hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and probability theory.\n",
    ">    \n",
    ">    2. **Statistical**: \"Statistical\" is an adjective that refers to something related to statistics. For example, \"statistical analysis\" means the analysis of data using statistical methods, \"statistical inference\" refers to drawing conclusions from data using statistical techniques, and \"statistical significance\" indicates the likelihood that a result is not due to chance. \n",
    ">    \n",
    ">    \"In summary, \"statistics\" is the broader field of study, while \"statistical\" is an adjective used to describe things related to statistics or statistical methods.\"\n",

    "### Why Statistical Analysis is important?\n",
    "* Helps us collect data using the proper methods, and employing the correct analysis.\n",
    "* Helps us conduct research and present the result effectively.\n",
    "* Find the structures in data and make the relevant predictions.\n",
    "* Apply statistical methods to build machine learning models."
