    ">    1. **Statistics**: Statistics is a field of study that involves collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. It deals with the methods for collecting, summarizing, and interpreting data to make decisions and draw conclusions. Statistics involves techniques such as hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and probability theory.\n",
    ">    \n",
    ">    2. **Statistical**: \"Statistical\" is an adjective that refers to something related to statistics. For example, \"statistical analysis\" means the analysis of data using statistical methods, \"statistical inference\" refers to drawing conclusions from data using statistical techniques, and \"statistical significance\" indicates the likelihood that a result is not due to chance. \n",
